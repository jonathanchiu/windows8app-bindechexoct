BinDecHexOct Converter
========================

An app I wrote for the Windows Phone that converts between binary, decimal, hexadecimal, and octal numbers. You can find the link to it [here](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/bindechexoct/b0b1196e-b9a5-45ba-b604-90db7ed42d63).

Info
----
- Single tap the 'Del/Clear' button to remove text one at a time.
- Double tap the 'Del/Clear' button to clear both the input and output box.
- There is a convert button, but conversion can also be done by tapping on the 'BinDecHexOct' title at the top of the app.
